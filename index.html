<p>
In May 2019, I defended my PhD in Computer Science from University of Southern California (USC). I am joining as a postdoctorate fellow in the Department of Psychiatry in Icahn school of medicine at Mt Sinai.

<p>
	I am interested in problem oriented research, specifically in machine learning. I have worked upon problems in domains, robotics, natural language processing, bioinformatics, psychiatry, neuroscience.
<P> 

I had been very fortunate to be guided for my PhD thesis by <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~galstyan/index.html">Prof. Aram Galstyan</A>. I was also guided by Prof. Greg Ver Steeg, Prof. Kevin Knight, Prof. Daniel Marcu.

<br>
<br>
I am also collaborating with Dr. Irina Rish< and Dr. Guillermo Ceechi, and many other brilliant folks in the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center. We are building representation learning algorithms, such as based on dictionary learning, inspired from the brain, for real world problems. Another interesting venture is computational psychiatry, specifically dialog modeling for therapeutic sessions.
<br>
<br>
In the past, I had the privilege of learning under guidance of Prof. Nora Ayanian, Prof. Amarjeet Singh, Prof. Fabio Ramos, and Commdel co-founders Nitin Gupta and Amit Verma.
