<p>
In May 2019, I defended my PhD thesis in the Department of Computer Science at University of Southern California (<a href="https://www.cs.usc.edu/">USC</a>). I am joining as a postdoctorate fellow in the Department of Psychiatry in Icahn school of medicine at <a href="https://icahn.mssm.edu/">Mt Sinai</a>.

<p>
	I am interested in problem oriented research, specifically in machine learning. I have worked upon problems in domains, robotics, natural language processing, bioinformatics, psychiatry, neuroscience.
<P> 

I had been very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Aram Galstyan for my PhD thesis, "Hashcode Representations of Natural Language for Relation Extraction". For the thesis, I was also guided by Prof. Greg Ver Steeg, Prof. Kevin Knight, Prof. Daniel Marcu, and Dr. Ulf Hermjakob, within USC.

<br>
<br>
I am also collaborating with Dr. Irina Rish and Dr. Guillermo Ceechi, and many other brilliant folks in the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center in NY. We are building representation learning algorithms, such as based on, dictionary learning inspired from the brain, kernelized locality sensitive hash functions (extensible for neural networks), information theory, etc. Another interesting venture is computational psychiatry, specifically machine learning based modeling of therapeutic dialogue sessions.
<br>

<br>
In the past, I had the privilege of learning under the guidance of Prof. Nora Ayanian, Prof. Amarjeet Singh, and Prof. Fabio Ramos.
