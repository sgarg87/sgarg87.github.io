<p>
I'm a PhD Scholar in the <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/technology_groups/insy/home">Intelligent Systems Division (ISD)</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.cs.usc.edu/">Department of
Computer Science</A> within the <A
HREF="http://viterbi.usc.edu/"> Viterbi School of Engineering</A> at the
<A HREF="http://www.usc.edu/"> University of Southern California (USC)</A>.  
<p>
My research interest is in data driven modeling of complex systems. Along these lines, in the past, I built machine learning algorithms for problems specific to robotics, environmental phenomena, network science, natural language processing, Cancerous biopathways. 
<P> 

I am very fortunate to have my PhD thesis adviser <A HREF="http://www.isi.edu/~galstyan/index.html">Prof. Aram Galstyan</A>. Also, guided by <a href="http://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about">Prof. Greg Ver Steeg</a> and <a href="http://www.isi.edu/~marcu/">Prof. Daniel Marcu</a> from time to time. Our main focus is to model the semantic representation of languages (AMR) using kernel functions, for structured inference problems.
<br>
<br>
I am also collaborating with <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-rish">Dr. Irina Rish</a> and <a href="http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-gcecchi">Dr. Guillermo Ceechi</a>, and many other brilliant folks in the <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/">IBM T. J. Watson Research Center</a>. We are building representation learning algorithms, such as based on dictionary learning, inspired from the brain, for real world problems. Another interesting venture is computational psychiatry.
<br>
<br>
In the past, I had privilege of learning under guidance of <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~ayanian/">Prof. Nora Ayanian</a>, <a href="https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~amarjeet/index.html">Prof. Amarjeet Singh</a>, <a href="http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/f.ramos/Fabio_Ramos_Homepage/Home.html">Prof. Fabio Ramos</a>, and <a href="http://commdel.net/company/leadership-team/">Commdel co-founders Nitin Gupta and Amit Verma</a>. I also had a luck of working with co-founders of <a href="http://www.snowpal.software/">Snowpal Software Services</a>, Krish Palaniappan and Harman Sahni, in its first couple of years as the sole developer (product development in education domain).
